Contacts API is an API that allows you to create, update, and delete contacts.

This projects is hosted on: https://contacts-api-nrestrepo05.herokuapp.com/contacts

## Technologies
This project was made with Node.JS, Express.JS, and Mongo DB.

## How to run it?
If you want to run it, yo need to create a Mongo DB wherever you prefer. I recommend Mongo Atlas.

If you already created your DB just follow the steps below:

1. Install dependencies
	```bash
	npm i
	```
2. create your .env file. The .env file must contain this:
	```bash
	CONTACTS_DB_USER=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
	CONTACTS_DB_PASSWORD=XXXXXXXXXXXXX
	CONTACTS_DB_PORT=XXXX
	```
3.  Now just run it with:
	```bash
	npm run nodemon
	```
Now it is running!
